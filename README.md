CoPilot Reflection

For this project I chose option a, and added a chart to the previos project, the follwing is a summary of my prompts I used to get the app to funtion properly

1. Initial request: "Now let's add a collapsible chart section. In this section let's add a pie chart that shows spend and category"

2. Legend and label formatting: "Let's focus on the pie chart, can you remove the total from the legend, leave only the name of the category and put the spend labels on the chart itself. Make it so it has 'category: $spend' and round to 2 decimal places"

3. Clean up legend display: "I need you to remove the total that displays before 'Category: 
$XX.XX'. The legend still displays the spend amount before 'Category: $XX.XX' and I need it to be gone. Remove the legend entirely."

4. Add custom legend: "Add a legend with this specific format 'category: $spend' rounded to 2 decimal places"

5. Reposition elements: "Can you make the legend next to the pie chart"

6. Adjust chart positioning: "The pie chart gets cut off on the left side, can we move it slightly. Just a little more to the right"
